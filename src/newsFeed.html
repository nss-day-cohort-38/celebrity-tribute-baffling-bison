                    tucking
                    into an ice cream by himself in Northern California, the location where he could be filming the next
                    instalment of the Matrix franchise. The actor, famous for his roles in the Bill & Ted movies, was
                    pictured sitting alone outside a Baskin-Robbins outlet in Alameda, in the Greater San Francisco
                    area. He
                    then posed in his usual nonchalant style for a picture alongside a clearly delighted fan. According
                    to
                    local media, the 55-year-old casually wandered into the store and grabbed a double scoop cone of ice
                    cream for himself, which - if it were anyone else - would be completely normal...<a

                    and then went in to confirm that, yes, it was Keanu. The star then graciously posed for a photo with
