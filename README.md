# Nashville Software School Tribute Agency

Welcome fans.

Your first task as a reporter of the NSSTA is to compile a tribute report on one of the many artists we are considering as a potential honoree winner. Listed below is the information we need to be gathered. Each one of you will be responsible for building a web page to present this information to our judges for consideration.

Keep in mind you should be practicing what you have learned so far in class. When you are building your site, make sure you are using semantic tags whenever possible and use Flexbox for styling instead of CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap or Materialize.

## All pages should include:
1. Navigation with links to the other pages of the report.
2. Social Media links in the footer.
3. Be sure to break each page into meaningful sections, include headings, and use bullet list where appropriate.
4. Valid HTML. Run each page of HTML code through the html validator at [https://validator.w3.org/](https://validator.w3.org/).

### Tips For A Good Usable Website
1. Use acceptable conventions
   * Logo positioned at top left
   * Navigation across the top or down the left side
2. Visual hierarchy
   * Most important information is the most prominent
3. Break pages up into defined sections
   * Logically related content should be related visually
4. That which is clickable should be obviously clickable.
5. Eliminate distractions
   * Use only two typefaces
   * Limit color pallet (3 colors with black and white)
   * Use a grid
6. Support scanning (users don't read)
   * Use plenty of headings
   * Short paragraphs
   * Bulleted lists
7. Strive for consistency.
